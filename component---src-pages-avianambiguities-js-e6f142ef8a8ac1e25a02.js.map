It expounds upon the \n                  theories and objections raised by myriad illustrious scientists, naturalists, \n                  philosophers and paleontologists: Thomas Huxley, Richard Owen, Charles Darwin, \n                  Samuel Wilbeforce, Anaximander, Louis Pasteur, Fred Hoyle, Samuel Wendell Williston, \n                  Othniel Marsh, Kenneth Dial, John Reuben and Devon Quick, in addition to the theorists themselves. \n                  {\"\\n\"}<br />\n                  <br />\n                  It follows a narration by two galactic microorganisms who are recording the Earth’s history prior to its destruction by a comet.\n                  {\"\\n\"}<br />\n                  <br />\n                  The tone of the narrative is informal and scientific terminology has been kept to a minimum. \n                  Much of the dialog is a paraphrase of statements, questions and interjections the characters have been recorded as saying. \n                  The original quotes have been included on the page in some instances. Each character is introduced with his or her name, \n                  professions, and a line or two on their work, or personality.\n                  {\"\\n\"}<br />\n                  <br />\n                  The evolution of life as we know is a complex, intricate process of painstaking development that \n                  we may never fully decipher – as evidenced by the myriad theories attributed to the origin of \n                  birds and its uncertainty even today. This book is intended to showcase the development of these \n                  conflicting theories of the evolution of birds as a synecdoche for our ambivalence in understanding \n                  our own creation, elaborating on our methods of unearthing, proving, presenting and maintaining \n                  knowledge and our unending iterative process of attempting to make sense of it.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </Fade>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default aa;\n"],"names":["aa","isDesktop","setIsDesktop","useState","isMobile","setIsMobile","useEffect","window","innerWidth","React","className","Link","to","Container","Title","title","Row","Col","md","sm","Fade","left","bottom","duration","delay","distance"],"sourceRoot":""}
